# 15-Squares-Puzzle

Implements classic 15-squares puzzle using JavaFX buttons. Every playthrough is completely randomized. 
The goal is to order the tiles 1-15 in order with the bottom-right tile being the empty tile at the end.
Players only need to click on one of the tiles with the empty square adjacent to move that tile to the empty space.

  -Window does not maintain aspect ratio on resize.
